## 🚀 Technical Challenges Overcome

During the development of this portfolio, I tackled several cutting-edge engineering obstacles:

### 1. React 19 & Next.js 15 Migration
Resolved complex type mismatches in external libraries like `recharts` and `react-resizable-panels`. Fixed "Unexpected any" ESLint errors and ensured proper property assignments for React 19 compatibility.

### 2. The "React2Shell" Security Patch
Successfully navigated and patched the **CVE-2025-66478** vulnerability. Managed specific dependency resolutions to ensure the platform is secure against Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.

### 3. Responsive 3D Typography
Implemented fluid font-scaling using viewport units (`vw`) combined with specific breakpoints to prevent text overflow on mobile devices while maintaining high-impact, bold headlines.
